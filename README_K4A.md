# Orbbec SDK K4A Wrapper

Welcome to the Orbbec SDK K4A Wrapper! 

This repo is forked from Azure Kinect Sensor SDK

This branch is base on release/1.4.x, and use new impl code base on Orbbec SDK to replace the k4a implementation.

The usage of this library is same as Native K4A

## Introduction

**Orbbec SDK K4A Wrapper** is contain the K4A wrapper for Orbbec SDK. It's mean that user can use this library to develop the application with K4A API, but use to access the Orbbec camera. Also user can use this library to replace native K4A library in your application to access the Orbbec camera without any code change.

**Support camera and platform:**  Orbbec Femto Mega: Windows10+, Ubuntu20.04+; x64 Orbbec Femto Bolt: Windows10+, Ubuntu18.04+; x64 Other Orbbec cameras and platforms without test, don't use it in production environment.

**What we did?**

The [k4a.h](./include/k4a/k4a.h) is the header file of K4A API, and the source code in [k4a.c](./src/sdk/k4a.c) is the implementation of K4A API. We have reimplemented the K4A API in [ob_k4a_impl.c](./src/orbbec/ob_k4a_impl.c) with Orbbec SDK, and keep the same effect as the original K4A API. Therefore, all functions called on user's side will be redirected to the Orbbec SDK, and user can access the Orbbec camera like the K4A device.

## Why use the Orbbec SDK K4A Wrapper

The Orbbec SDK K4A Wrapper enables you to get the most out of your orbbec camera. Features include:

* Depth camera access
* RGB camera access and control (e.g. exposure and white balance)
* Motion sensor (gyroscope and accelerometer) access
* Synchronized Depth-RGB camera streaming with configurable delay between cameras
* External device synchronization control with configurable delay offset between devices
* Camera frame meta-data access for image resolution, timestamp and temperature
* Device calibration data access
