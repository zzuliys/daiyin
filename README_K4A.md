# Orbbec SDK K4A Wrapper

Welcome to the Orbbec SDK K4A Wrapper! 

*This repo is forked from [Azure Kinect Sensor SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK)*

*This branch is base on release/1.4.x, and use new impl code base on [OrbbecSDK](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK) to replace the k4a implementation.*

*The usage of this library is same as [Native K4A](./README_K4A.md)*

## Introduction

**Wrapper** is contain the K4A wrapper for Orbbec SDK. It's mean that user can use this library to develop the application with K4A API, but use to access the Orbbec camera. Also user can use this library to replace native K4A library in your application to access the Orbbec camera without any code change.


**What we did?**

The [k4a.h](./include/k4a/k4a.h) is the header file of K4A API, and the source code in [k4a.c](./src/sdk/k4a.c) is the implementation of K4A API. We have reimplemented the K4A API in [ob_k4a_impl.c](./src/orbbec/ob_k4a_impl.c) with Orbbec SDK, and keep the same effect as the original K4A API. Therefore, all functions called on user's side will be redirected to the Orbbec SDK, and user can access the Orbbec camera like the K4A device.

## Why use the Orbbec SDK K4A Wrapper

The Wrapper enables you to get the most out of your orbbec camera. Features include:

* Depth camera access
* RGB camera access and control (e.g. exposure and white balance)
* Motion sensor (gyroscope and accelerometer) access
* Synchronized Depth-RGB camera streaming with configurable delay between cameras
* External device synchronization control with configurable delay offset between devices
* Camera frame meta-data access for image resolution, timestamp and temperature
* Device calibration data access

## Installation
* Windows Device Setup

On Windows, once attached, the device should automatically enumerate and load
all drivers.

* Linux Device Setup

On Linux, once attached, the device should automatically enumerate and load
all drivers. However, in order to use the Orbbec SDK K4A Wrapper with the device and without
being 'root', you will need to setup udev rules. We have these rules checked
into this repo under 'scripts/99-k4a.rules'. To do so:

* Copy 'scripts/99-k4a.rules' into '/etc/udev/rules.d/'.
* Detach and reattach Azure Kinect devices if attached during this process.

Once complete, the orbbec camera is available without being 'root'.
